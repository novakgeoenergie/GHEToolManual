Scenario management
*******************
Every calculation you do within GHEtool is done in a *scenario*. This left bar handles everything related to the management
of all those different scenario's. You can add new scenario's, delete them, rename them and move them around by dragging-and-dropping.
With *update scenario* you can save changes you made to the program.

Input tabs
******
For every calculation, different information is needed. All these inputs are structured in *tabs*, being:

* **Aim** **`tab aim`_** The first tab determines what you will be calculating in this specific scenario.
* **Options** The option tab contains aim-specific options.
* **Borefield** Here the borefield configuration can be chosen.
* **Earth** The earth tab contains information about the ground thermal properties and the simulation options.
* **Thermal resistance** This tab contains the information w.r.t. the thermal resistance of the borehole.
* **Thermal demand** Here one can enter the thermal demand for the borefield.
* **Results** Here one can find the results once a scenario is calculated.
* **Report** This tab contains all the information w.r.t. the report like a scenario description.
* **Settings** This tab contains settings for the project.

Input area
******
For every tab, the specific inputs are shown in this area.

Action buttons
**************
These buttons are only clickable when you have activated the software either with a trial license
or with a bought one. You can calculate the current scenario, calculate all scenario's or export everything
to a pdf-report.

Settings
********
The last important part of the interface are the settings buttons.
When first opening the tool, two options are shown: *request a trial license* and *buy a pro license*.

If you already have a license, you can activate it by clicking on *settings*.
Under settings you also can find the user manual of GHEtool Pro.
