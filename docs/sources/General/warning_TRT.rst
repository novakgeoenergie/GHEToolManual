.. warning::
    Using TRT-data for the aim of determining the required depth is dangerous, since the measured borehole equivalent thermal resistance
    is only valid for one specific depth (since this parameter is a function of the depth). Since this aim changes the depth of the boreholes
    the borehole resistance will change as well. This effect can be very significant if you have a fluid regime on the border of laminar/turbulent flow
    (see also :ref:`reynolds number`).

    Please use this only as a first estimate and for final depths that are in line with the depth of the measured borehole.
