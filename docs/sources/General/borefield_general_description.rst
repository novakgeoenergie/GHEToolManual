* **Borehole depth [m]** The depth of the borehole in meters.

.. caution::
    Please note that the borehole depth is relative to the burial depth, as is used in the convention by Here the convention of (Cimmino and Bernier, 2014) [1]_.
    So if you have a burial depth of 1m and a borehole depth of 100m, the total drilled depth is 101m.

* **Borehole spacing width [m]** This is the distances between consecutive boreholes in the width direction.

* **Borehole spacing length [m]** This is the distance between consecutive boreholes in the length direction.

* **Number of boreholes in the width direction [-]** This is the number of boreholes in the width direction.
    If you multiply this with the borehole spacing in the width direction, you get the total borefield width.

* **Number of boreholes in the length direction [-]** This is the number of boreholes in the length direction.
    If you multiply this with the borehole spacing in the length direction, you get the total borefield length.

* **Buried depth [m]** The level at which the borehole starts, relative to the ground level. It can be seen as the
    depth at which the horizontal pipes are installed.

* **Borehole radius [m]** This is the radius of the drilled hole, which is typically between 0,06-0,1m.
