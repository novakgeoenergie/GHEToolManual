.. note::
    The **pipe roughness** plays a role in when a fluid goes from laminar to turbulent flow (see also our article on :ref:`reynolds number`).
    Some manufacturers use rough pipe internals so they achieve a turbulent flow at lower mass flow rates. If this is the case,
    please contact the manufacturer for the correct data to put into GHEtool.

    You may also always contact us at `info@ghetool.eu <mailto:info@ghetool.eu>`_ if you want a specific brand to be implemented in the software.
